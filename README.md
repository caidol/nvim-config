# nvim-config

This repository is an nvim config which I have been working on. It contains all standard features
such as LSP, telescope, treesitter and a sleek yet colourful gruvbox colourscheme.

The inspiration for the colourscheme has come from the youtuber jdh, who also has used neovim recently in his videos
with the same gruvbox colourscheme.


Below is a picture showing what the editor looks like (this is upon opening a Python file):
